# Client and model catalog reconciliation

Research date: 2026-10-06 (Asia/Jakarta). Source baseline: `ff469a0768a854ebe7d6d5936702c669c5cd91f5`.

## Scope and evidence

The baseline inventory contains 119 active provider definitions and 1,044 static provider/model rows. The resulting registry contains 1,164 rows: 120 additions (100 chat, 8 image, 6 embedding, 6 TTS), with no baseline rows removed. Reviewed factual metadata has 342 exact provider/model records across 36 providers. Some factual records describe compatibility variants rather than standalone registry rows.

`model-catalog-coverage.json` enumerates every current static row and explicitly marks rows not individually reverified. Enumeration is exhaustive; internet verification of every historical value is **not** complete. The 827 preserved, individually unverified rows are not certified accurate. Separate media research enumerated 70 providers and 288 provider/kind/ID definitions, including voice/language surrogates rather than only independent models.

The fetched models.dev catalog contains provider-scoped limits, modalities, costs and tier information. It is a comparison source, not proof that an IDE subscription or individual account can serve a model.[1]

Official endpoint-specific documentation takes precedence over a generic family record. API context, maximum input, maximum output, client configuration ceilings and compaction thresholds remain separate. No production database, authenticated provider account, live inference or deployment was used.

## Important context correction

GPT-6.1 Sol's OpenAI API specification is **1,050,000 total context**, **922,000 maximum input**, and **128,000 maximum output**.[2]

The official Codex `rust-v0.160.0` model catalog instead declares **272,000 default context** and **872,000 maximum configurable context** for this model. The protocol calls the latter the “Maximum context window allowed for config overrides”; it separately defines 95% effective context and a 90% automatic-compaction threshold.[3][4]

Consequently, Zen does not relabel the API limit as an independently proven Codex backend limit. The selected Codex configuration value remains separate from API maxima in `metadata.limits`; unverified route input/output maxima are `null` and omitted from top-level numeric limit fields. Account-supplied live metadata and explicit operator declarations can override the static reference without crossing provider boundaries.

## Client updates

- Claude Code: latest-channel non-prerelease `2.1.289` and inspected Stainless SDK `0.128.0`. The explicit stable tag is `2.1.285`; next-only `2.1.290` is not selected. Existing runtime assumptions and beta entitlement flags were not broadened.[13]
- Kiro CLI: `2.27.0`, including the previously stale connection-test User-Agent. The IDE version remains a separate identity.[15]
- Kimchi: `1.6.0`.[16]
- CodeBuddy CN CLI: `2.161.3`; the unverified INTL IDE-labelled wire profile remains separately pinned rather than pretending the CN CLI release verifies it.[14]
- Gemini CLI remains `0.62.0`; its OAuth Code Assist header now follows the inspected auth-library branch rather than the API-key genai branch.[17]
- Copilot chat/models API identity follows the bundled `copilot-api` versioned behavior; token/user-info retains its different API date.[18]
- Antigravity IDE, CLI and Hub remain distinct release lines. Updating a CLI changelog reference does not change the IDE fingerprint or enable account-gated models.[20]

Codex, Cursor, Kiro IDE, Grok stable, Zed, OpenCode and Qoder pins were researched and retained where unchanged. Trae, Windsurf and Devin source definitions remain inactive. Protocol-specific checksum/signing identities and unverified bundled runtime pins were not guessed from unrelated package releases.

## Consistency repairs

- Browser-safe generated provider identity metadata covers canonical IDs, storage/display aliases and declared upstream model aliases without importing server registries into browser resolvers.
- Capabilities and pricing use consistent provider identity. Exact native namespaces and `:free` routes remain distinct; catalog schema v3 rejects old normalized cache files.
- Daily catalog joins distinguish Kimi Code/Z.ai coding plans from direct API products. Reviewed provider-specific facts apply to exact resolution paths without replacing unrelated gateway protocol restrictions.
- Public/dashboard discovery preserves native model IDs, live typed metadata, custom overrides, intentional chat/STT duplicate IDs and no-auth providers. Operator-declared runtime capabilities are scoped by provider and native model ID.
- Numeric custom input/context/output values persist separately. Public chat listings expose `max_input_tokens` where known, rather than conflating it with `context_length`.
- Long-context reasoning follows the relevant output tariff when appropriate; saved partial user tariffs merge consistently for display and billing. An inclusive threshold can be explicitly declared instead of forcing every provider into a strict-greater-than rule.
- Per-model target transport now follows the translation target when no supported native source transport exists. Models declared Responses-only by the gateway dispatch to `/responses`; native compatible transports retain precedence and stale credential transport state is cleared. GPT-6.1 Sol uses this gateway policy to support tool calls consistently; its upstream Chat Completions endpoint also supports requests without tools.[2]

## Pricing semantics

xAI's documented long-context boundary is inclusive; Gemini pricing distinguishes output thinking, cached reads and time-based storage. These cannot be represented by a universal cache-write multiplier.[6][7]

DeepSeek publishes peak and off-peak schedules. The recorded reference rates and schedule are preserved, but automatic time-of-day billing selection remains a limitation rather than a claim that one flat price is universally correct.[5]

Subscription quotas, regional CNY tariffs, images, characters, duration and modality-specific token prices remain labelled in `metadata.billing`. Only compatible USD-per-million-token quotes enter the token calculator. Unknown tariffs are shown as “Not specified,” not as zero/free; numeric usage costs remain local estimates, not guaranteed upstream invoices.

OpenAI image pricing separates text/image input and image output. Gemini Embedding 2's input allowance and embedding dimensions are not completion-token limits; Zen's existing adapter is text-only even though the native model supports more modalities.[10][11]

## New-model safety and explicit deferrals

OpenCode Go additions use documented model-specific Messages or Responses endpoints, not a blanket Chat Completions route.[9]

Antigravity documentation advertises plan-gated Claude 5.5 models, but the exact internal IDs and account limits were not independently established; they were not fabricated from Anthropic API names.[8]

Cohere output ceilings are corrected from its model reference, but additional Aya models remain deferred because the documented compatibility endpoint differs from the pre-existing registry transport.[12][19]

Other explicit gaps are preserved in the coverage file and research handoff:

- No claim of live serving, account entitlement or universal Command Code major-version protocol compatibility.
- Incompatible realtime, managed-agent, WebSocket STT and missing media adapters were not added merely because a catalog lists them.
- OpenRouter/MiniMax image protocol corrections, existing historical media table drift, Qoder Lite retirement handling, and some hosted provider tariffs remain separate follow-up work.
- Existing unreviewed family estimates and dated compatibility IDs are retained for backward compatibility, not newly validated.
- 9router issues were triaged against this fork. Unrelated namespace-tool translation, Cursor exec and nested Qoder queue defects were not silently bundled into the catalog change.

## Verification

All tests use isolated HOME/DATA_DIR, fresh test secrets and live-provider flags disabled. New behavior has ordinary RED/GREEN regression evidence. Verification includes full Vitest, zero-warning ESLint, production Next build, provider/alias/OAuth baselines, real built-server model/pricing API reads, SQLite custom-limit read-back, and a Chromium pricing form smoke with intercepted save. No provider inference is required for these checks.

The exact final gate totals and reviewed source hashes are recorded in the external handoff, so later review corrections do not leave a stale count in this document.
