# Changelog

## 0.9.7 — 2026-10-06

This release collects the previously merged maintenance batch; the version bump adds no separate product feature. Requires **Node.js >=22.19.0**. The package remains `@joyccn/zenrouter`, with binary `zenrouter`.

### Catalog and client identities

Add **120 provider/model entries** (100 chat, 8 image, 6 embedding, 6 TTS) and **342 sourced metadata records**; **827 historical entries remain not individually verified**. Keep API versus IDE/OAuth/coding-plan limits, prices and unknowns separate. Repair provider/pricing aliases, model transport, no-auth discovery, cross-kind IDs, live/operator capabilities, separate input/context/output limits and long-context/custom pricing. Non-token prices are not token tariffs; unknown prices are not free. Reconcile researched client pins and endpoint-specific Gemini/Copilot headers without granting beta entitlements.

### Reasoning and usage

Preserve explicit/nullable output caps and native thinking through final serialization; do not silently increase a paid cap. Keep Responses reasoning fields and effective Claude interleaving support, including rejected-beta retries. Account exhausted attempts, fold Gemini thoughts once, retain incomplete terminals/partial output/refusals, prevent terminal-then-cancel double persistence and false empty-combo replay. No automatic larger-budget retry is added. Codex OAuth, OpenCode Muse and Cursor still do not enforce the public API cap; a token cap is not a total monetary budget.

### Grounded search

Bare provider names and `provider/search` select defaults, not upstream model names. Validate explicit/combo ownership before dispatch. Antigravity uses its dedicated sandbox, real project/request/session IDs, model/thinking mapping, Google Search and per-account strict proxy. Exclude `thought: true` from answers and citation context. The specific Gemini model 404 uses one account attempt; the exact ambiguous Antigravity resource 404 uses at most **three**, without healthy-account cooldowns. Success clears only the matching search scope; other auth/quota fallback remains.

### Dependencies, installer and interface

Refresh React **19.3.0**, ESLint **10.12.0**, Vitest **5.0.3**/Vite **8.3.2** and Undici **8.11.2**. Preserve Node 22 dispatchers, CONNECT, DNS pinning, cancellation and fail-closed proxy policy; remove unused dependencies. The installer verifies the exact runtime minimum and freshly linked CLI. Bundle Monaco **0.57.0** and same-origin workers, fix docs markdown/language switching and React warnings without losing drafts/hydration safety. Narrow ESM boundaries leave CommonJS launchers unchanged; optional SQLite fallback stays available.

### Release publication

Manual npm/Docker workflows require the actual stable tag and exact source commit; npm provenance also matches the dispatch ref/SHA. Persisted original tarballs are recovered with registry SHA512 verification. Global serialization and numeric version checks stop older retries from replacing newer `latest`; missing recovery artifacts fail closed.

### Verification, security and upgrade limits

Prior verification includes isolated tests, zero-warning lint, app/CLI builds, docs export, browser checks and real loopback/standalone SQLite search/usage acceptance. Final local release verification: **494 test files, 4,091 passed, 100 skipped, 1 todo, zero failures** on Node 22.23.2; zero-error/zero-warning lint, CLI packaging and Docker smoke checks pass. No production accounts, live provider inference, new spending retries or automatic deployment were used. Catalog research **does not establish account entitlement or live availability**.

TLS verification remains enabled; self-signed fixture exceptions are per-request, not global. **node-forge and braces advisories remain**: this is not a vulnerability-free release. After publication, install `@joyccn/zenrouter@0.9.7` or use the pinned `joyccn/zenrouter:0.9.7` image. Container publication targets **linux/amd64 only**; persist **/app/data** and back it up before upgrading. Documentation does not certify publication or tag availability.
